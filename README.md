# Work-Schedule-Planner

## Description

Our challenge for this project was to create a simpler calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.

## HTML

    The syntax used in the HTML was:

    - Me simply editing and changing around a few things.
    - I had to define hours from 9 AM - 4 AM with div id's.
    - I had to change some div tags to "textarea" tags and "button" tags.

## CSS

    The syntax used in the CSS file was:
    
    - already made for this assignment.

## Javascript
    - The javascript took me longer to grasp but nonetheless was able to code out what I did.
    - Was able to make a loop to be able to loop around to be able to change colors on the planner
      to illustrate what colors represented the past, present and future.
